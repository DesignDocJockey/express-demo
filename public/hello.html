        <p>You are working on an API endpoint to create a new user and you will require some data along with the request like <em>firstname</em>, <em>lastname</em>, <em>age</em> and <em>birthdate</em> for the user you are about to create. Obviously, passing <code>Sally</code> as value for <em>age</em> or <code>53</code> for <em>birthdate</em> won&apos;t get things rolling in the right direction. You really don&apos;t want bad data making its way through your application so what do you do? The answer is <strong>Data Validation</strong>.</p>
